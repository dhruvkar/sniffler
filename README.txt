This is a simple network sniffer developed for my Raspberry Pi. 

ASSUMING MONITOR MODE IS ENABLED:
It can sniff the network and record all data in a log file.
It can also inject a packet into the network. It will ask for a Source IP address/port as well as a Destination IP address/port.

This is my first program written from scratch! (05/01/2014)
